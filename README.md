# Where did our team get this templet?
Here is the link that we downloaded this templet http://templated.co/3 . 

# Why did We choose this templet?
Because this one is very simple for us to analyze the code, by the way we have studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript only but some websites are involved with other languages such as bootsrap and others than this. For this templet has only CSS, HTML, and JS only. So we decided to choose this one.

# What did we do on this templet?
We changed the contents and tried to understand the code for each line and we changed some codes to make it better.

# What we use this templet for?
This templet is all about tourism. It shows about places for tourists to come and enjoy with those places with the views and beautiful places. It is like a commercial website.
